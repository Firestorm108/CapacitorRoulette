# CapacitorRoulette
A roulette that explodes capacitors! 
It explodes huge capacitors as the roulette function, kind of like russian roulette. It utilizes transistors and relays and buttons to explode capacitors, as everyone loves explosions. I made this because I felt that there wasn't enough explosions at the moment and making a fun game (that's harmless) while also making it explosive is the best way to do it. Overall, it's a great fun explosive time for everyone while also being safe!

This is achieved by overvolting the capacitors by +40V and putting them in reverse polarity!
